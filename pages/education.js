                Main factors of medication adherence: health literacy,
                organizational health literacy, and health equity. Disease
                stigma also contributes to less help-seeking behaviors & poorer
                health outcomes, especially within high risk individuals who
                don&apos;t seek out medical diagnoses or treatment for diseases
                such as mental health disorders, HIV infection, or substance use
                disorders.

                To spread awareness of medication adherence: increase health
                literacy through health promotion, primary and secondary
                prevention strategies such as health fairs with free health
                screenings, and educational tools for health promotion such as
                community outreach events for the public.

                Medication adherence reduces the impact of a disease, prevents
                long-term damage and can be part of a treatment plan to return
                people to their original health. When patients do not take their
                medication for diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, or
                hyperlipidemia it often results in frequent medical emergencies,
                permanent disability, and eventually premature death. When
                patients adhere to their medication regimen it allows healthcare
                professionals to focus on preventative treatment versus
                emergency treatment.

                Tips to improve adherence: finding a system and routine that

                Pulmonary: Although COVID-19 is asymptomatic for most, patients

                acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 12.3% of them needed

                those with COVID-19, even if they are under the age of 50. In a

              High blood pressure is something PTs must take into consideration
              when treating patients. PTs are movement specialists, and our job
              is to get people moving. When it comes to acute care settings
              (in-patient hospitals, ICUs, SNFs, etc.), blood pressure is taken
              before, during, and after most treatments.

            <li className="mt-1.5 text-base tracking-tight text-slate-100">
              Asthma treatment through PT can vary for each patient. Treatment
              options focus on improving the quality of breathing or the
              efficiency. Breathing techniques can be practiced and prescribed,
              such as diaphragmatic breathing or pursed lip breathing. The
              muscles used for breathing can be strengthened through
              neuromuscular education, using a device that provides a resistive
              load against inspiration, or even aquatic exercise. The water in a
              pool will provide resistance against inspiration, but this will
              need to be monitored as it can be too restricting on patients
              especially if they already had breathing difficulties.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-1.5 text-base tracking-tight text-slate-100">
              Other considerations for asthma treatment are if the patient has
              mucus build up in their respiratory system. There are percussive
              treatments and postural drainage techniques that PTs can use to
              help clear the lungs based on where the mucus has built up. There
              are also techniques to help the patient cough most effectively to
              clear mucus. One such way is using a very quick cryotherapy
              application. Taking an ice cube in a quick swipe to the
              patient&apos;s back can cause the expiratory muscles to fire and
              produce a cough.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-1.5 text-base tracking-tight text-slate-100">
              Lifestyle changes for patients with asthma include limiting
              exposure to respiratory irritants, like dust, smoke, pet dander,
              etc. Postural education and correction can also benefit those with
              asthma. Poor posture can limit the ability of the respiratory
              muscle to function properly/efficiently and can limit the amount
              that the lungs can expand while breathing. This can include
              stretching tight muscles and joints and strengthening others,
              depending on the presentation of the patient.

              We have not had much discussion on COVID-19 specific treatments
              within the realm of physical therapy. Assisting patients in
              sitting, standing, and walking as tolerated will benefit their
              condition or at least limit the negative impact of symptomatic
              COVID-19.
