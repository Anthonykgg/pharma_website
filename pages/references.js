                Pulmonary: Although COVID-19 is asymptomatic for most, patients
                can get very sick with symptoms. In a study conducted in the
                United States, 20% of people with diagnosed COVID-19 developed
                acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 12.3% of them needed
                mechanical ventilation to stay alive. (See "Coronavirus disease
                2019 (COVID-19): Critical care and airway management issues",
                section on 'Clinical features in critically ill patients'.)

                Cardiovascular: Other complications arising from COVID-19
                infections also include heart-related issues, such as
                arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, and shockâ€”likely to do with
                the lung ventilation issues that could lead to hypoxia or the
                strong immune responses associated with COVID-19 infections
                [27,66,122,123]. One of the most surprising findings is an
                increase in risk for pulmonary embolism and acute stroke for
                those with COVID-19, even if they are under the age of 50. In a
                series of 21 severely ill patients admitted to the ICU in the
                United States, one-third developed cardiomyopathy [122].

                Thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism and
                acute stroke (even in patients younger than 50 years of age
                without risk factors), have also been reported [124-130].

                Neuro: Encephalopathy, or disease affecting the brain, is also a
                common and unique side affect to the COVID-19 infection, with
                some studies reporting encephalopathy in up to a third of
                hospitalized patients. Out of all the neurological symptoms,
                loss of smell, inability to taste, and muscle weakness are
                common, while stroke, movement disorders, motor and sensory
                deficits, ataxia, and seizures occur less frequently.

                Inflammation: Some patients with severe COVID-19 have laboratory
                evidence of an exuberant inflammatory response, with persistent
                fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, ferritin),
                and elevated proinflammatory cytokines; these laboratory
                abnormalities have been associated with critical and fatal
                illnesses [25,132,133].
